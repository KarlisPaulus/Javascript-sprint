# JavaScript Sprint

This repository contains various JavaScript practice exercises, mini-projects, and learning files from my school sprints. Each file or project in this folder demonstrates different JavaScript concepts.

## ðŸ“Œ About
This sprint folder includes hands-on coding exercises and small projects that help me learn and apply JavaScript concepts. Some projects are simple practice files, while others experiment with interactivity, events, and logic.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML & CSS** (for styling and structure)
- **Browser APIs** (DOM manipulation, Event Listeners, etc.)

## ðŸŽ® Example Project: Alpha-Jail
One of the interactive mini-projects in this folder is **"Alpha-Jail"**, a JavaScript-based experiment with mouse tracking and keyboard interactions.  

### ðŸ“Œ Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my JavaScript learning journey!
